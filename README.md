A simple Android app built to locate heart resource centers in a nearby proximity based on Zip Code, programmed in Java and heavily based on open-sourced code found online.

Was orignally developed to be a companion app to a UC Davis Medical School student's project, but was no longer needed after COVID-19. Hence, it is in an incomplete state.

However, the app has full Google Maps integration, geolocation markers, and a functional location search bar. Helped me learn a bit more about Java and about Google API integration.
